32 Ask for Opinions/Analysis: If the original prompt only asks for a fact, such
as ’What is X?’, the improved prompt could be, ’What is X, and what are its
implications for Y?’
33 Encourage Creativity: For creative writing prompts like ’Write a story about
X,’ an improved version could be, ’Write a fantasy story about X set in a world
where Y is possible.’
34 Include Multiple Perspectives: For a prompt like ’What is the impact of X on
Y?’, an improved version could be, ’What is the impact of X on Y from the
perspective of A, B, and C?’

improved version could be, ’Describe X, focusing on its physical features, historical significance, and cultural relevance.’
36 Combine Related Prompts: If you have two related prompts, you can combine
them to create a more complex and engaging question. For instance, ’What is
X?’ and ’Why is Y important?’ could be combined to form ’What is X and why
is it important in the context of Y?’

X,’ the improved version could be, ’What is X? What are its main characteristics? What effects does it have on Y and Z?’

the arguments for and against the truth of X?’

47 Suggest explanation to others: Change the prompt to suggest that the user try to
explain the problem to someone else as a way to simplify it.
